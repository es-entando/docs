# Introduction

Entando is a UX innovation platform designed to help enterprises rapidly build modern user experiences on Kubernetes. We speed up the process of developing apps on Kube, and support enterprises in their move to the cloud and modern development frameworks.

## Why Kubernetes?

::: tip How Google Runs Containers in Production
Each week, Google deploys over 2 billion containers in production to run all of its services like Gmail, YouTube, and Search. Kubernetes is Google's solution to automating the management of containers at scale.
:::

Instead of you working to ensure your services and applications are running, Kubernetes does the work for you. It actively seeks to achieve your desired state, and can automatically self-heal and scale up and down to match utilizatiion.

Over 50% of enterprises are on Kubernetes including Amazon EKS, Google Cloud Platform (GKE), IBM (Red Hat) OpenShift, Microsoft Azure (AKS), and VMWare Pivotal (PKS).
